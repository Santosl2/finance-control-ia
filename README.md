   ```

3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/finance_db
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token

   OLLAMA_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   FEATURE_FLAG_SAVE_TO_GOOGLE_SHEET=true

   USE_OLLAMA=false // Set to true if you want to use Ollama for AI processing
   ```

4. Set up Google Sheets credentials:

   - Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
   - Generate credentials and save them to `credentials/credentials.json`
   - Share your Google Sheet with the service account email
